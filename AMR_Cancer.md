Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has posed a significant public health crisis for decades. By 2050, the global mortality rate associated with AMR is projected to reach millions, potentially making it one of the top causes of death. When combined with another major health crisis and a top cause of death, such as cancer, the situation becomes even more dire \[1\]. (Figure 1\)

**Risk factors for infections in cancer patients**

Cancer patients usually receive chemotherapy as part of their treatment plan. This weakens their immunity, making them more prone to infections. Other factors associated with increased infection rates in cancer patients include the dosage and duration of chemotherapy \[2\], surgeries \[3\], treatment-related neutropenia, and stem cell transplantation \[1\]. Furthermore, infections in cancer patients are more fatal, with mortality rates that are almost three times higher than the population \[4\].

**Resistant infections in cancer patients**

As cancer patients are susceptible to various infections, they are usually exposed to prolonged antibiotic regimens, which contributes to AMR development. AMR adds to the burden posed by infections on cancer patients. In the USA, more than a quarter of pathogens that cause post-chemotherapy infections are drug-resistant \[5\]. Additionally, high rates of resistance were found in ESKAPE pathogens that were isolated from bloodstream infections in cancer patients in the USA. (Figure 2\) These are a group of six pathogens that are commonly found in hospitals and are usually antibiotic-resistant: *Enterococcus faecium*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Acinetobacter baumannii*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, and *Enterobacter* *spp* \[1\]. 

**Strategies to Combat AMR in Cancer Care**

Strategies other than the use of prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be implemented to face the rising challenge of AMR in cancer patients. One of those strategies is infection prevention. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provided guidelines for patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers on the best practices to prevent infections in cancer \[6, 7\]. Additionally, antibiotic stewardship programs should be implemented in hospitals to optimize antimicrobial use and minimize AMR rates.  
 Another good strategy is regular surveillance for the early detection of AMR outbreaks and proper intervention \[8\].

**Conclusion**

Cancer patients are at a higher risk of severe infections with increased fatalities due to their compromised immunity. The situation is further worsened by the rising AMR crisis which threatens treatment outcomes. To combat this, it is essential to implement comprehensive strategies that go beyond antibiotic use, such as focusing on infection prevention, optimizing antimicrobial use, and maintaining vigilant surveillance.
